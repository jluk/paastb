# My deployment fails with allocation errors

## **Recommended steps**
Your Cloud Service deployment (Staging and/or Production) can get pinned to a single cluster. When the cluster reaches its capacity, then deployments will fail. Try the following steps.

1. Wait for some time and retry the operation <br>
Resources may be freed up on the cluster after waiting that allow the deployment or scaling request to succeed. â€¯ 
2. Create a new Cloud Service then deploy your package <br>
This will often go on a new cluster with enough capacity. If successful, update the DNS to point to the new Cloud Service. 
3. Delete both production and staging slots and create a new deployment in the existing cloud service <br>
The new deployment will go to a cluster that has enough capacity. This will, however, incur downtime until the new deployment is ready. 
4. Remove the affinity group and [migrate to a Regional Virtual Network] (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-migrate-to-regional-vnet/)
